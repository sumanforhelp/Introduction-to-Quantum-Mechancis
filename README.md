In classical mechanics we try to figure out the position of the particle at every instant of time i.e. x(t). Under given initial condition if Newton's law at certaion intant of time then we can determine the position. If forces involved is conservative then Newtons law in general can be written as derivative the postential wrt spatial variable .i.e.
